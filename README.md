## Summary
#### I do not think there is positivity bias for Vine review for the Watch category. 31.9% of Vine reviews were 5-starts, compared to 51.8% of non-Vine reviews. 47 reviews is not many, it is possible that Vine reviews were simply for below-average products. It is also possible that Watch reviewers are more likely to leave a critiqued and honest review for there product as they could have a lot of pride in watches vs a reviewer for a category like Athletic Wear.
